				<h1>The Era of Mass Surveillance</h1>

			<p>Mass surveillance is the surveillance of the population of an entire nation or nations. Mass surveillance is carried out by governments and corporations usually on behalf of governments. Mass surveillance has been justified to fight against terrorism and to protect national security.</p>

				<h2>Mass Surveillance is a Global Issue</h2>	
			</header>
			<section class="link-border">

				<p>In 2013, the world was hit with a shadow reality due to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Snowden">Edward Snowden’s</a> global Surveillance disclosure. As a contractor for the NSA, Edward saw first hand the abuse of power and control of the United States against it’s own people and several other countries. In response to the NSA’s activities Snowden copied and leaked global surveillance programs conducted by the United States NSA, and NSA’s allies the “Five Eyes” composed of Britain, Canada, Australia and New Zealand. They conducted mass surveillance by gathering metadata from all telephone and devices connecting to the internet. With the help of internet companies they were able to intercept internet communications at large scales.

				<h2>Your metadata knows you better than anyone else. </h2>	
			</header>
				<p><b>Metadata is the information about information</b>. Communication metadata collects information about the senders and receivers. This includes, phone numbers, email addresses, screen names etc. Attached with this information is information on the time, duration and location of the communication. On top of this it stores information about the device used for the communication. This includes make, model, screen size, operating system, browser and just about anything else they can collect. 

Metadata is collected by every major internet company such as Google, Facebook and Twitter. The NSA programs exposed by Edward Snowden shows how they collect all metadata from every major internet company.

				<p>
				Daryl Johnson is a former DHS counterterrorism analyst who spent 15 year researching domestic terrorist groups. In 2009 he wrote an <a href="https://www.wired.com/2012/08/dhs/">analysis</a> on Right-Wing Extremism that warned about its rising threat. Unfortunately, the DHS repudiated his paper under pressure from conservative politicians. Instead DHS focused on people with muslim and islamic backgrounds. 
<br>
To continue on the facts that our government's counterterrorism efforts aren’t balanced like they should be i’d like to introduce you to the FBI’s Domestic Investigations and Operations Guide. The <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3416775-DIOG-Redactions-Marked-Redacted.html#document/p229/a336287">FBI’s DIOG</a> carefully states its policies and activities when it comes to investigating domestic groups. Domestic groups investigated include and are often subject to priority are political and religious groups. Although it’s guide doesn’t allow for illegal surveillance, the FBI violated its own policies when investigating environmental activist such as the Key Stone Pipeline protestors. Evidence has been published by <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/may/12/revealed-fbi-spied-keystone-xl-opponents">The Guardian.</a>
