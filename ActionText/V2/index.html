			<span>Contrary to popular assumption the development of stronger oversight mechanisms in the United States, actually lead to greater secrecy, self-regulation, and abuse of power rather than security and protection.

The rise in this era of mass surveillance is a parallel systematic procedure conducted by internet companies such as Google and Facebook and government entities such as the NSA, CIA, and the FBI.

				<h1 align="center"> Mass Surveillance is a Global Issue</h1><br>
				<span>In 2014, the world was hit with a shadow reality due to Edward Snowden’s Global Surveillance disclosures. Edward Snowden is a former Central Intelligence Agency employee and a National Security Agency  contractor. As a contractor for the NSA, Edward saw first hand the abuse of power and control of the United States against it’s own people and several other countries. “Many of the programs were aimed at the American population, but dozens of countries around the planet — including democracies typically considered US allies, such as France, Brazil, India and Germany— were also targets of indiscriminate mass surveillance ”<br>_<br>

In response to the NSA’s activities Snowden copied and leaked global surveillance programs conducted by the United States NSA, and NSA’s allies the “Five Eyes” composed of Britain, Canada, Australia and New Zealand.</span>

				<span>
				Communication metadata collects information about the senders and receivers. This includes, phone numbers, email addresses, screen names etc. Attached with this information is information on the time, duration and location of the communication. On top of this it stores information about the device used for the communication. This includes make, model, OS, and just about anything else it can collect. 
				</span>
				<span> For example, metadata that often goes without mention is photo metadata which is commonly known as EXIF data. Similarly to communication metadata, photo metadata stores everything it can. For example this includes, GPS location, make/model, time and even the application used to edit the photo. </span>
