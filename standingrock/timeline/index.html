                            <h2>Mapping 7 million gallons of crude oil spills</h2>
                            <p>The question is not if a pipeline will spill but instead it is a matter of WHEN  a pipeline will spill. 
                            <br>
                            A total of more than 168,000 barrels of oil were spilled as a result of the reported incidents. That’s more than 7 million gallons.
                            <br>
                            Many of the spills were small, releasing less than 10 barrels of oil, but some were huge. In 2013, lightning struck and punctured a pipeline in North Dakota. It leaked more than 20,000 barrels, or 865,200 gallons, of oil, making it more than eight times the size of the Santa Barbara spill.
                            <br> 
                            Plains All American, the parent company of the operator of the broken pipeline at Santa Barbara, is no stranger to spills. It experienced at least 120 accidents over the five year period. And that’s not unusual: Almost every company listed experienced multiple spills.

By the Dawes Allotment Act, the federal government intended to break up the communal tribal lands in Indian Territory and other reservations and allocate portions to households to encourage subsistence farming on the European-American model. In 1887, Congress passed the General Allotment Act, also called the Dawes Act to break up communal Indian lands into individual family holdings. On 2 March 1889, Congress passed another act (just months before North Dakota and South Dakota were admitted to the Union on 2 November 1889), which partitioned the Great Sioux Reservation, creating five smaller reservations: Standing Rock Reservation, Cheyenne River Reservation, Lower Brule Indian Reservation, Pine Ridge Reservation (Oglala Sioux),Rosebud Indian Reservation.</p>
